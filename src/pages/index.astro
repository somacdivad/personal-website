			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>
				I am a professional technical writer with over a decade of experience in the tech industry.
				Currently, I lead the Docs and Education Team at <a href="https://relational.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RelationalAI</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				My motto is: "Just say the damn thing."
				I believe that clarity and simplicity are the keys to effective communication.
				These principles guide all of my work, whether that's designing a documentation system, crafting educational materials, publishing blog posts, or writing a love letter to my wife.
			</p>
			<p>
				You'll have to judge for yourself whether I live up to that ideal.
			</p>
			<h2>My Writing</h2>
			<p>
				At work, I write about programming and artificial intelligence, with a focus on Python and SQL.
				My personal writing covers a range of topics including technology, parenting, music, and philosophy.
			</p>
			<p>
				I publish my personal writing on my <a href="/blog">blog</a> and on <a href={SOCIAL_LINKS.find(link => link.name === 'Medium').href} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Medium</a>.
