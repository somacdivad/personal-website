I've just returned home from a *quinceañera* with my wife, and while I do enjoy enjoy the celebration, I find it a bit overstimulating.
I left somehow feeling both bloated and deflated.
I need to decompress and recharge my batteries.
Thanks from a tip from the good folks at [*You'll Hear It*](https://youtu.be/fdCNqdavWoE?si=f8O419a8xz0WbYg0), I had a hunch that *R&B Organ Trio* might help.

I've followed guitarist Charlie Hunter for years, but wasn't familiar with either Corey Fonville (drums) or Sam Fribush (Hammond B3).
What a trio they make!
The worst part of *R&B Organ Trio* is that it's too short, clocking in at only 18 minutes.
But those are 18 minutes I'll gladly put on repeat.

The trio sets the mood with a cover of Roberta Flack's "Feel Like Makin' Love", featuring solid, soulful drumming smothered in a layer of slick organ and punctuated by Hunter's guitar.
There's a real Jimmy Smith vibe going on here.

From there, the trio settles down into "Why Don't You," a dreamy R&B jaunt written by vocalist Cleo Sol (who's featured on [#2026-15](/blog/an-album-a-day-2026-15)).
The organ tone is gorgeous; somehow smooth and gritty at the same time.
This is good medicinal music: laid back, happy, and a little bit hypnotic.

Next up, "Café Milano" leans into a breezy bossa nova groove.
Hunter's guitar work shines on all five tracks, but on this one it's white hot.
The solo work is tastefully restrained, and his syncopated comping is spot on.

After proving their mettle on the first three tracks, the trio cements their place in the pantheon of great organ trios on the last two songs:
"Sparks," an intimate, jazzy ballad with dub undertones featuring vocalist Ronnie Luxe, and the closer "I Couldn't Love You More."
The latter has what business insiders call "the thang"—an irresistible groove, organ that'll take you church, and guitar work that'll make you cuss under your breath.

Next time you need a little lift, give *R&B Organ Trio* a spin.
If after 18 minutes your batteries aren't feeling recharged, just hit repeat until they are.
You won't regret it.

## What is "An Album a Day"?

Each day in 2026, I'm listening to an album that:

1. I've never heard before
2. Was released in the last six months (from the time of listening)
