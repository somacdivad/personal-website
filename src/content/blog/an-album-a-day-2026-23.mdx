I have been waiting for this record for a while now, primarily because it features pianist/organist/keyboardist John Medeski, of Medeski Martin & Wood.
He has been perhaps the biggest influence on my own [piano style](https://soundcloud.com/amosd2/sets/transit-live-from-the-rhythm) and I am beyond thrilled to have new Medeski material to listen to.

Here, Medeski plays the sideman to guitarist Julian Lage.
I have loosely followed Lage for the last couple of years.
I wasn't so into his 2024 Speak To Me record, but was always impressed whenever I'd come across a live performance on YouTube.
Whatever was missing for me on Speak to Me (maybe it was Medeski?) has found its way onto Scenes From Above.

Not too long ago I learned that Lage suffers from focal dystonia, a neurological condition where, as I understand it, faulty brain signals cause spasms or muscle contractions in your hands, or other parts of the body.
Tragically, Lage's hands are impacted.
I don't know how Lage feels about it, but I think if it happened to me I would feel like the universe was playing a cruel joke, robbing me of both my likelihood and artistic capacity.

In Lage's case, the joke is on the universe.
On Scenes From Above, whatever impacts focal dystonia has had, whatever physical restrictions it has imposed, are imperceptible.
Just listen to the virtuosic acoustic guitar solo on "Havens."

Immediately following "Havens," Lage treats us to a beautiful ballad and exercise in restraint called "Night Shade."
The juxtaposition of "Havens" and "Night Shade" is wonderful.
This pair of songs might be my favorite part of the record.
"Night Shade" features some of my favorite playing from Lage and Medeski, not to mention bassist Jorge Roeder and drummer Kenny Wollesen.

I'm old enough to know the danger of eager anticipation.
I've been let down so many times.
But I couldn't help myself when I learned about Scenes From Above.
Fortunately, everything on Scenes From Above is a masterpiece.
It was well worth the wait.

## What is "An Album a Day"?

Each day in 2026, I'm listening to an album that:

1. I've never heard before
2. Was released in the last six months (from the time of listening)
