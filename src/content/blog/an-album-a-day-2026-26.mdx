A fun game to play when listening to new music, especially instrumental music, is to try to guess the age of the musicians.

Like most records in my ["An Album a Day"](/blog/tags/an-album-a-day/) series, I was drawn to *Inkyra* because of its unusual album art.
But from the first note it was clear that I'd happened upon a masterpiece.
This could only have been created by a fully-fledged artist, that is, someone who has found their voice and is in full command of their craft.

*Inkyra* opens with "Earthrise," a tone painting involving a sweeping synth pad and flute that intertwine.
It ebbs and swells, eventually giving way to a driving rhythm section and fiery saxophone line on "Particles of Change."
There's a lot going on.
I hear influences from Herbie Hancock to Weather Report to Joshua Redman to Kurt Rosenwinkel to Snarky Puppy.
But it's not like any of that in a way that's hard to pin down.
It's fresh and epic and bold and adventurous.

Track after track, again and agin, *Inkyra* impressed me.
How the hell did I miss such a colossal artist?
What have I been _doing_ these past few years?
Clearly not listening to enough Emma Rawicz.

Picking a favorite song wouldn't be unfair, it'd be immoral.
They're all my favorite, each and every one.
I'm doomed to be disappointed by all other music, now.
But I'd rather have tasted of *Inkyra*'s sweet nectar than to have lived my life in ignorance.

Imagine that.
It's only January 26th and I may have just found my favorite album of 2026.
Hell, maybe of the decade.

And it's all thanks to Emma Rawicz, the saxophonist from London, the fully-formed artist, the 24-year-old master.

## What is "An Album a Day"?

Each day in 2026, I'm listening to an album that:

1. I've never heard before
2. Was released in the last six months (from the time of listening)
