A fun game to play when listening to new music, especially instrumental music, is to try to guess the age of the musicians.

Like most records in my ["An Album a Day"](/blog/tags/an-album-a-day/) series, I was drawn to *Inkyra* because of its unusual album art.
And from the first note, it was clear that I'd happened upon something made by a mature artist–someone who has found their voice and is in full command of their craft.

*Inkyra* starts off with "Earthrise," a tone painting that opens with a sweeping synth pad and a beautiful flute solo.
It swells and ebbs, eventually giving way to a driving rhythm section and fiery saxophone line on "Particles of Change."
There's a lot going on.
I hear influences from Herbie Hancock to Weather Report to Joshua Redman to Kurt Rosenwinkel to Snarky Puppy.
But it's also _not_ like any of that in a way that's hard to pin down.
It's deliciously non-derivative.

Track after track, *Inkyra* impressed me again and again.
How on earth could I have missed such a colossal talent?
What have I been _doing_ these past few years?
Clearly not listening to enough Emma Rawicz.

There's no way for me to pick a favorite track here.
The entire record is my favorite.
It's set a new bar.
One not _too_ high, I hope, or I'm doomed to be disappointed going forward.

Imagine that.
It's only January 26th and I may have just found my favorite album of 2026.
Hell, maybe of the decade.

And it's all thanks to Emma Rawicz, the **_24-year-old_ (!!)** saxophonist from London.

## What is "An Album a Day"?

Each day in 2026, I'm listening to an album that:
