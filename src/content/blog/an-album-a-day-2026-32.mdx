Jazz has been a part of my life for almost three decades now.
And yet after all that time I can count on one hand the number of trombone players I'm aware of.
I've always drifted towards piano, saxophone, guitar, and trumpet.
*Indigo* made me realize that I haven't given the trombone enough attention.

My introduction to trombonist [Nabou Claerhout](https://www.nabouclaerhout.com) coincides with *Indigo*'s release on January 30, 2026.
I stumbled across [a YouTube video](https://youtu.be/KN1W5EA0Q4k?si=j-mDOx1aexLg43di) of the Nabou Claerhout Trombone Ensemble (comprised of five trombones and a rhythm section), was impressed, and made a note to check out more of the group's music.
Just a few minutes later, I saw *Indigo* featured in a [new music round up](https://youtu.be/fdCNqdavWoE?si=ZTFjTMvghUW1LWx1) on the You'll Hear It podcast.
So here I am two days later soaking up everything *Indigo* has to offer.

I love how dark and introspective the trombone sounds on *Indigo*.
Claerhout's tone is smooth and round and lacks the harsh brassiness I associate with the instrument.
On tunes like "Consent (for Stijn)" and "Flux Bloom," she wields her instrument like a voice, managing an easygoing baritone one moment and a plaintive falsetto the next.

Claerhout, though, is unafraid to flirt with brashness.
On "Unpersuadable Extern," she tickles the edge, like a tube guitar amp pushed to the point of just breaking up without ever punching through into full-on distortion.
Her control is incredible.
At times the trombone and guitar meet in unison where they meld into a strange and surprising sound unlike anything I've heard before.

The highlight of the record for me is "Light Blue Shawl (for Stijn)."
Claerhout delivers a tasteful ballad with hints of melancholy and free jazz.
She flirts with harshness again, creeping up to, but never quite crossing, the line--except *maybe* right at the very end.
The guitar work by Gijs Idema is stunning, too, pitching back and forth between lush chords and sharp, stoccato harmonics.

*Indigo* is a beautiful album that showcases the trombone in all its versatility.
It also, in my mind, establishes Claerhout as one of modern jazz's most unique voices.
It's a dense record with lots to digest.
But damn does it taste good.

## What is "An Album a Day"?

Each day in 2026, I'm listening to an album that:

1. I've never heard before
2. Was released in the last six months (from the time of listening)
