One thing growing up in the church teaches you is the power of repetition.
That power has two sides to it.
On the one hand, it grounds you.
Knowing what to expect and when to expect it offers consolation in a chaotic world.
But there's a darker side, too.
Repetition dulls the axe of reason, wearing it down until it's incapable of cutting through all but the weakest of arguments.

*Gospel Music*, the new album from vibraphonist [Joel Ross](https://www.joelrossmusic.com), wields repetition as both a balm and a blade.
There is a lot to like about the record.
Not least of all the recording quality, which is astounding.
Everything is crystal clear.
The mix is divine.
The playing is top-notch, too, with Ross leading an immaculately tight sextet comprised of, besides himself:

- **Josh Johnson** - alto saxophone
- **Maria Grand** - tenor saxophone
- **Jeremy Corren** - piano
- **Kanoa Mendenhall** - bass
- **Jeremy Dutton** - drums

The group works well together.
Such a large ensemble risks cacophony, but Ross shepherds them expertly through tasteful arrangements.

Where *Gospel Music* stumbles, though, is an overbearing repetition.
The dynamics are fairly flat, and the compositions rely heavily on repeated motifs.
From one song to the next, the sameness wore on me.
It's a little hard to understand, too.
The album is described as following "the arc of the grand biblical story",[^1] from which one would expect a more pronounced sense of narrative progression.
Instead, the songs blur together into a homogeneous mass.

There are a few standout tracks, though.
"Protoevangelium" offers a peaceful and meditative vibe with some exceptional textures.
"Hostile" gets borderline fiery and features some of Ross's most impressive vibraphone work on the record.
Towards the end, "The Giver" treats us to a more traditional gospel sound with phenomenal vocals by Andy Louis and lyrics inspired by a James Baldwin poem.

Like my own experience with the church, *Gospel Music* has its moments.
But in the end, it fails to offer much philosophical depth or variety of experience.

## What is "An Album a Day"?

Each day in 2026, I'm listening to an album that:

1. I've never heard before
2. Was released in the last six months (from the time of listening)
