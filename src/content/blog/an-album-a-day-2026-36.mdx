If I could go back in time and give my younger self advice, there I two things I would say: don't do things because someone pressures you to, and take more chances.
I took a chance on Waan's newest album, *We Want Waan*, and I'm glad I did.
But, I'm sorry to admit, I only listened to it because Apple Music's algorithm kept recommending it to me and I caved to the pressure.

I've never been a big fan of electronic music.
But *We Want Waan* is now the *second* electronic album I've listened to as part of this project, and I'm beginning to think I've misjudged the genre.[^1]

*We Want Waan* covers a lot of ground in its 43 minutes.
The first three songs would all feel right at home in an any contemporary jazz afficionado's playlist.
"Talking Trees" especially stands out with its crunchy, angular drums and wailing saxophone.

The middle of the record leans more punk and noise rock, with songs like "Why Didn't You Get Me" and "In Dirt" featuring distorted guitars and weird synth patches.
There's almost a Gorillaz vibe, which I didn't expect but really enjoyed.
But the jazz influence is never far away, and tracks like "Moto No Oto" and "In Doubt" almost convince you that this really is a jazz record.

But then we're dropped into "Been Blue," a straight up hip-hop track with some serious A Tribe Called Quest influences.
And *that's* followed by "Lodge Texas", a more traditional EDM track, complete with a thumping kick drum and a build-up to a drop.
And *that* leads you into the record's final track, "Cecilyum", a 6-minute ambient synth piece that would be at home on a Radiohead album.

*We Want Waan* is a wild ride, but somehow manages to feel cohesive and unified.
I really had no idea what to expect when Apple Music recommended an electronic record with a purple monkey riding a turtle on the cover, but I'm glad I took the chance.
Maybe all I needed to get out of my comfort zone was a little bit of pressure.

## What is "An Album a Day"?

Each day in 2026, I'm listening to an album that:

1. I've never heard before
2. Was released in the last six months (from the time of listening)
