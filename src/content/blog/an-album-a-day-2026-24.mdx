Good background music supports you emotionally without distracting you from whatever you're doing.
It's note boring, but also never challenges you too much.
*Loup(s)* is good background music.

On the French guitarist's latest album, Matthis Pascaud blends ambient electric guitar with subtle saxophone and synth lines, and a penchant for grooves in 6/8 time.
The result is a relaxing vibe with hints of post-rock and jazz fusion.

There are a few standout tracks.
"Rose" features some captivating vocals by Celia Kameni and some excellent interplay between guitar, vocals, and keyboards.
"Gran Sasso" is another highlight, with what might be the most interesting melody on the album.
But overall, there's nothing flashy or catchy here.
It's the kind of music you'll bob your head to, then forget about five minutes later.

I don't mean that as a criticism.
*Loup(s)* has a place in my rotation for a deep work session or some late-night reading.
I just don't see myself putting it on for much else.
