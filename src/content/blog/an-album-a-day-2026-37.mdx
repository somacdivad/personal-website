As I was cleaning out my desk the other day, I pulled out from a deep and forgotten corner of a drawer an old wooden shaving box that had belonged to my late grandfather.
When I opened it, I was slapped by the aroma of his aftershave, a scent I hadn't smelled for years, and was instantly transported to a time in my young adult life when I lived with him for a few months; a time when I was struggling to find my footing in the world, and an experience that helped me understand my father in a new way.

Listing to *Minimal*, I had a similar experience.
It transported me to a time sitting in my high school's band hall, the smell of slide grease and spit in the air, and the moment when I was first struck by the beauty of mallet percussion.
Something about the attack of the mallets on the bars evokes a visceral reaction in me that I can feel on the back of my neck.
*Minimal* excited that feeling for the first time in a long time.

The music on *Minimal* is hypnotic and meditative.
It's similar in many ways to Erik Hall's *Solo Three*, which I listened to a few days ago.[^1]
But where *Solo Three* is more about texture, *Minimal* is more about rhythm and harmony.

*Minimal* can be divided into four parts:

The first part is a suite of three songs called "Mallet Quartet."
These are highly enjoyable, especially the first part which features some unexpected and gorgeous modulations.

The second is a song called "Seven Eleven," a 10-minute piece that is more rhythmically complex than "Mallet Quartet."
The time signature is 11/4 (it sounds like 6 + 5 to me) with 7-bar phrases.
What the song lacks in melodic interest, it makes up for with its unusual rhythm and interesting harmonic progressions.

The third part is another three-song suite called "Avant, pendant, et pourtant," which is French for "Before, during, and yet."
These might be my favorite songs on the record.
They incorporate more sounds--droning, scraping, and bowing--and tell a more dynamic story.
"Pendant" is especially captivating.

The final part is a 9-minute song called "Sunday."
It's got a laid-back groove, a singable melody, and sounds like what a lazy afternoon in bed with a good book feels like.

I shouldn't be surprised at how diverse and emotionally resonant mallet percussion music can be.
I guess I'm not, really, I had just forgotten.
*Minimal* is a testament to the power of sound, like smell, to trigger memories and emotions.
I'll definitely be checking out more Percussions de Strasbourg in the future.

## What is "An Album a Day"?

Each day in 2026, I'm listening to an album that:

1. I've never heard before
2. Was released in the last six months (from the time of listening)
