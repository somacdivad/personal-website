The best music is spontaneous. I chose to listen to Sault's Chapter 1 after a friend texted me a link to the album. I'd never heard of Sault and had no idea what to expect. In other words, it was the ideal album to listen to.

Chapter 1 could have been recorded in 1970. Or 2025. It is equal parts fresh and classic. Musically, there are influences as diverse as Marvin Gaye, Lou Reed, the Beetles, Chaka Khan, and the Meters—sometimes all at the same time. Lyrically, the record is built for the Tik Tok generation with a focus on simplicity, repetition, and current issues. Learn one or two phrases and you learned an entire song.

What I enjoyed most about Chapter 1 is how human it sounds. The bass flubs some notes, the vocals are a bit out of tune, and the drums wiggle around a beat without really locking in. Yet it doesn't sound amateur; it feels alive and in the moment, as if it were recorded in a single take. Apparently, Sault dropped Chapter 1 without warning, adding to the record's off-the-cuff vibe.

In a world often obsessed with perfection and virtuosity, Chapter 1 is a welcome diversion.
