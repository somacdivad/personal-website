I admit the only reason I listened to this record is because I liked the album art.

At first, I thought I wouldn't be able to take this album seriously.
It has a childish quality to it.
In some ways, it sounds like something you might hear at a kid's birthday party.
You know, the kind of kid's music that tries to be hip enough for the parents to tolerate.

But *Starting To Get Light* is no kiddie record.
The music isn't very sophisticated, but the songwriting is solid, the arrangements are clever and well executed, and the lyrics... oh, the lyrics.
The songs on *Starting To Get Light* are about a middle-aged man grappling with the realities of aging in world going crazy.

I'm a bit of a connoisseur of middle age myself, these days.
So despite the whimsy of the music, I felt a connection to the themes Ballew explores here.

My favorite song is "Weaponize My Love."
It's a psychadelic pop tune with a great groove, a catchy melody, and fun vocal harmonies, and lyrics that made my head spin:

> Love can be fun but it can also be a gun that kills \\
> every ounce of empathy with one fatal shot \\
> loving all the weaponizers isn't just a hobby it's an absolute necessity the only chance that we've got \\
> the evolution of the creature and the fear of the preacher \\
> fighting for the win while everybody starts to rot

I'll need to be in a special kind of mood to listen to *Starting To Get Light* again.
But I'm glad I gave it a chance.
You should, too.
