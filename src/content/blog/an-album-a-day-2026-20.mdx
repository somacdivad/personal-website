I don't listen to much electronic music, but for forty-two (42) minutes, I let Fabiano do Nascimiento and E Ruscha V take me on a trip to water planets all over the universe.
I have a feeling I'll be returning to *Aquáticos* for many years to come.

What impressed me the most was how naturally the musicians meld the organic and the electronic.
Fabiano's guitar is earthy and raw, while simultaneously shimmering like something electric.
The synthesizers sparkle and fizzle like live wires, yet I could swear they're breathing.

The album's title *Aquáticos* makes sense.
Every song sounds wet.
Close your eyes and you'll find yourself submerged in some alien ocean teeming with glowing coral and weird fishes.
Listen to "Bio" and you'll see what I mean.

I was surprised how much jazz/fusion language there is on this record.
Some moments you'd swear you were listening to Herbie Hancock's Headhunters.
Others, some long lost Miles Davis outtake from Bitches Brew.

Do yourself a favor.
Find forty-two (42) minutes and a good pair of headphones, turn out all the lights, and give Aquáticos a spin.
You need a vacation.

## What is "An Album a Day"?

Each day in 2026, I'm listening to an album that:

1. I've never heard before
2. Was released in the last six months (from the time of listening)
