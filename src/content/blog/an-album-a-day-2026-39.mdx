Cosmique Hypnotique's self-title album sounds like what you'd get if you'd asked a high school student to write an avant garde soundtrack for Spongebob Squarepants.
It's simple, playful, weird, and a bit chaotic.
There is some talent on display, but it never escapes sounding amateurish.

While I didn't find anything profound in this music, it did provoke some interesting thoughts about why that is.
I think there are two main reasons.
First, the melodies, when there are any, are familiar and uninspired.
They are repetitive, and not in an interesting way.[^1]
And, second, the rhythm is too straight.
There's little to no syncopation, and when there is the groove is too predictable.
For the few moments where things do get interesting, the group teeters on the brink of falling apart.

This appears to be Cosmique Hypnotique's debut album.
It's a decent effort.
There's enough here to suggest potential, but I don't think they've found their footing just yet.

## What is "An Album a Day"?

Each day in 2026, I'm listening to an album that:

1. I've never heard before
2. Was released in the last six months (from the time of listening)
