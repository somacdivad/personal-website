I'm about to say something that might sound tautological, but nature has felt inescapable lately.
I just added *The Light Eaters* by Zoë Schlanger to my reading queue.
Yesterday, my daughter came home from school and announced that she's joining the Texas Parks and Wildlife Junior Ranger program.
And during my morning reading today, I was moved to pause and enjoy the birdsong outside my office window.

And so, when browsing the new releases section on Apple Music, I was immediately drawn to *Stories of Life* by Triosence.
The album artwork is a gorgeous painting of a shirtless man sitting on a rock looking out over a body of water surrounded by trees.
It's 40 degrees fahrenheit outside, here, and I have to work so I thought "Here's my chance to get a little sunshine."

I found *Stories of Life* in the jazz section.
And I can see why to most people it might sound like jazz.
Triosence is a piano trio, after all, featuring acoustic piano, upright bass, and drums.
But to me, this album is more about atmosphere and mood than it is about jazz.

There's not a lot of swing, and there's not a lot of color in the improvisations.
I hear a few ninths here and there, but mostly sustained chords and simple harmonies.
At the risk of pretension, to me the music sounds a bit like something I might here in one of those modern, artsy church services.

Don't get me wrong, there's some skillful playing here.
I particularly enjoyed the bassist.
"Marrekesh Swing" is a highlight (even though it doesn't swing), and so is "Tomato Party" (which might be the most interesting song on the record).

Things pick up a bit towards the end of the album.
On "Dear Rainer," we finally get a bit of color from the piano.
"These Simple Things" and "G. Brothers" deliver the jazziest moments on the album, with the bass again deserving the most praise.

Overall, *Stories of Life* is a pleasant enough listen.
For a certain listener, it might be the real deal.
But if I were the man on the album cover, I don't think I'd be craving *Stories of Life* in that moment.
I'd reach for something a little wilder, a little more untamed.

## What is "An Album a Day"?

Each day in 2026, I'm listening to an album that:

1. I've never heard before
2. Was released in the last six months (from the time of listening)
