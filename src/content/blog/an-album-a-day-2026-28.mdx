I'm about to say something that might sound tautological, but nature has felt inescapable lately.
I just added *The Light Eaters* by Zoë Schlanger to my reading queue.
Yesterday, my daughter came home from school and announced that she's joining the Texas Parks and Wildlife Junior Ranger program.
And during my morning reading today, I was moved to pause and enjoy the birdsong outside my office window.

And so, when browsing the new releases section on Apple Music, I was immediately drawn to *Stories of Life* by Triosence.
The album artwork is a gorgeous painting of a shirtless man sitting on a rock looking out over a body of water surrounded by trees.
It's 40 degrees fahrenheit outside and I work from home so I thought "Here's my chance to get a little sunshine."

I found *Stories of Life* in the jazz section.
And I can see why to most people it might sound like jazz.
Triosence is a piano trio, after all, featuring acoustic piano, upright bass, and drums.
But to me, this album is more about atmosphere and mood than it is about jazz.

For one, there's not a lot of swing.
The improvisations lack color.
I hear a few ninths here and there, but mostly sustained chords and simple harmonies.
At the risk of pretension, *Stories of Life* sounds a bit like something I might expect at a modern, artsy church service.

Don't get me wrong, there's some skillful playing here.
I particularly enjoyed the bassist.
"Marrekesh Swing" is a highlight, even though it doesn't swing.
So is "Tomato Party," which might be the most interesting song on the record.

Things pick up a bit towards the end of the album.
On "Dear Rainer," we finally get a bit of color from the piano.
The jazziest moments belong to "These Simple Things" and "G. Brothers".
Again, it's the bass that really shines.

Overall, *Stories of Life* is a pleasant enough listen.
For a certain listener, it might be the real deal.
But if I were the man on the album cover, I don't think I'd be craving *Stories of Life* in that moment.
I'd reach for something a little wilder, a little more untamed.

## What is "An Album a Day"?

Each day in 2026, I'm listening to an album that:

1. I've never heard before
2. Was released in the last six months (from the time of listening)
