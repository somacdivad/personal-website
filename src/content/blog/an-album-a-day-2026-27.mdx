My head is still spinning from [yesterday's album](/blog/an-album-a-day-2026-26), so forgive me if my take on *Olha Maria* is a bit wonky.
It's not easy think clearly when your brain's been blown wide open.

English guitarist Hugo Lippi's latest record has a timeless, classic feel to it.
I appreciate a little dip back into some standards today to balance out the cosmic newness that shook me yesterday.
They're lottle warm hugs from old friends.

Lippi bounces back and forth between acoustic and electric guitar.
On both, he displays a deft touch well versed in straight ahead jazz.
There's some solid bebop on display on "Alley cats," for example.

I do have to hand it to Lippi for his choice of covers.
(Jazz covers of popular music is one of my favorite genres.)
Lippi treats us to a fantastic rendition of Steely Dan's "Do it again."
We also get a lovely take on Edith Piaf's "Hymne à l'amour".

Which gives me reason to mention some of the album's guests.
Trumpeter Stéphane Belmondo lends his voice to "Hymne à l'amour" and "Little Sunflower."
It's on the latter where Belmondo really shines, delivering a soft and playful interpretation of the Freddie Hubbard classic.

And then we have pianist Gael Rakotondrabe who, with five tracks—just shy of half the album—is the most prominant ivitee.
It's clear why.
Rakotondrabe shines as both an accompanist and soloist.
Heks one of those players that connect with a piano in such a raw way that it gives the piano a sharp, visceral, and distinct voice.

So yes, *Olha Maria* is a treat.
I liked it a lot.
It's a nice soft pillow on which to rest my head after yesterday's mind bending trip.

Sometimes the familiar is just what you need.

## What is "An Album a Day"?

Each day in 2026, I'm listening to an album that:

1. I've never heard before
2. Was released in the last six months (from the time of listening)
