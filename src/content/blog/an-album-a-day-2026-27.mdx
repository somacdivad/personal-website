My head is still spinning from [yesterday's album](/blog/an-album-a-day-2026-26), so forgive me if my take on *Olha Maria* is a bit wonky.
It's not easy think clearly when your brain's been blown wide open.

English guitarist Hugo Lippi's *Olha Maria* has a timeless, classic feel to it.
I appreciate a little dip back into some standards today.
To balance out the cosmic newness that shook me yesterday.
A warm hug from an old friend.

Lippi bounces back and forth between acoustic and electric guitar.
On both, he displays a deft touch well versed in straight ahead jazz.
We hear some bebop on display on "Alley cats," for example.

I do have to hand it to Lippi for his choice of covers.
He treats us to a fantastic rendition of Steely Dan's "Do it again."
Jazz covers of popular music is one of my favorite genres.
We also get a lovely take on Edith Piaf's "Hymne à l'amour".

Which gives me reason to mention some of the album's excellent guests.
Trumpeter Stéphane Belmondo adds his voice to "Hymne à l'amour" and "Little Sunflower."
It's on the latter where Belmondo really shines, delivering a soft and playful interpretation of the Freddie Hubbard classic.

And then we have pianist Gael Rakotondrabe who, with five tracks—just shy of half the album—is the most featured guest.
It's clear why.
He shines as both an accompanist and soloist.
Rakotondrabe is one of those players that connect with a piano in such a raw way that it gives the piano a sharp, visceral, and distinct voice.

So yes, *Olha Maria* is a treat.
I liked it a lot.
It was a nice entry back into reality after yesterday's dimension-hopping trip.

Sometimes the familiar is just what you need.
