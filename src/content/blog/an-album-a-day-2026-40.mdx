*Zuversicht* is the 40th album I've listened to this year.
I've stopped thinking so much about how I choose what to listen to next, picking mainly based on two rules: is it a genre I tend to like, and was it released recently?
I'm not sure if it's a good long-term strategy, but it has turned up some absolute gems that I might have overlooked otherwise.
*Zuversicht* is one such gem.

From the first tune, *All Hands On Deck*, I was hooked.
There's a beautiful piano drone over a steady backbeat that expands into lush and colorful harmonies.
For his part, Wülker's trumpet is restrained and tasteful, but _damn_ the piano is gorgeous.
As well it should be, considering the keys are helmed by the one and only Aaron Parks, a personal favorite.

The record's personnel are all top notch.
Aside from Parks, it boasts Gregory Hutchinson on drums and Linda May Han Oh on bass.
Masters all, and an unwavering rhythm section that could hoist even the most mediocre of soloists to greatness.
Wülker is no mediocre soloist, though.

Most of the tunes on *Zuversicht* have a sweetness to them.
Wülker's trumpet is light and airy, almost shy, though not in a bad way.
It's rather effective, honestly, at making the rare moments of intensity all the more impactful.

My favorite tune is *Second Nature*, a longing ballad that features some incredible bass work from Han Oh.
I love the way the trumpet and bass double up on the melody.
I couldn't immediately recall another tune that does that, and it gives the song a unique and memorable sound.

*Zuversicht* may not be a top ten album for me, but it's a solid record.
There's good reason to come back to it, and I expect I will.

Each day in 2026, I'm listening to an album that:

1. I've never heard before
2. Was released in the last six months (from the time of listening)
