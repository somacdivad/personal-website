There is a particular head movement I do when listening to music that has "it."
It's involuntary.
I tilt forward, slightly askew, suck my teeth in a half-smile-half-grimmace, and bob my head left and right.
I've never known how to describe what "it" is, other than it's whatever makes me do that.

*Flowers*, Soulive's latest release, has "it."

I thought Soulive was defunct.
The last I'd heard from them was 2018's *Cinematics, Vol 1*.
Turns out I'd missed a 2024 release—*Cinematics*' second volume—so I'll be promptly rectifying that omission.

2018 feels like a lifetime ago.
*Flowers* reflects that with a maturity that wasn't as pronounced in their earlier work, as far as I can remember.
Soulive has always been funky, but in a just-out-of-high-school-and-full-of-ego-and-testosterone kind of way.
*Cinematics* felt a bit more grown up than earlier records.
Now, on *Flowers*, Soulive is funky in a well-traveled-and-wisely-weary kind of way.

Coming in at the top for me is probably "3 Kings" with it's slinky groove and bluesy undertones.
The guitar absolutely sings, evoking the best of Hendrix or Stevie Ray Vaughan, but without being anything less than Eric Krasno.
Second place goes to "Window Weather," the closing track.
It's got a wonderfully quizzical feel and a modern fusion vibe.
Definitely a good soundtrack for window gazing.

I'm happy to see Soulive back in action.
They've had a long career, and were always one to watch, in my book.
With *Flowers*, they're now one to keep.

They've found "it."

## What is "An Album a Day"?

Each day in 2026, I'm listening to an album that:

1. I've never heard before
2. Was released in the last six months (from the time of listening)
